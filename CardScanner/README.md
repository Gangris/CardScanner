# Gangris Card Scanner Module
This Python application runs a series of motors and a camera to take photos of collectable cards. These cards will be uploaded by the Price Checker module to AWS for image to text conversions of the titles of the cards. This code was initially taken from https://www.hackster.io/mportatoes/trading-card-scanner-organizer-84399a but was modified to have some of the configuration stored in `configation.json` instead of being hard coded.
